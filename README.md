### DynamicShinyPlotWindows

DynamicShinyPlotWindows a set of functions for showing multiple plots in a Shiny window.   
The number of plots can be changed by increasing / decreasing the number of rows / columns.   
   
Beneath each plot there is legend window that may be used for describing the content of the plot.

### setUiLegendRow()
The function setUiLegendRow() looks quite clumsy. 
However, it seems to work and more sophisticated variants didn't.
Nevertheless, I would appreciate a more neat solution.
